# *Diffuse image-base lighting*

The key point of the technique is to use the texture as a light source. In my case, I used the provided on labs cube map as skybox and as the light source at the same time.

I have a pair of shaders for skybox and model.

Graphics techniques that were used:
-Textures
-Cube Map
-Diffuse
-Gamma Correction

Gamma correction used for the blurring image. 
Also used Fresnel shick for the approximating bottoms intensity
